# Training of Python scikit-learn models on Azure

## Overview

This scenario shows how to tune a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) matching model that can be deployed as a web service to provide predictions for user questions. For this scenario, "Input Data" in the architecture diagram refers to text strings containing the user questions to match with a list of FAQs. The scenario is designed for the Scikit-Learn machine learning library for Python but can be generalized to any scenario that uses Python models to make real-time predictions.

## Design

![alt text](Design.png "Design")
The scenario uses a subset of Stack Overflow question data which includes original questions tagged as JavaScript, their duplicate questions, and their answers. It tunes a Scikit-Learn pipeline to predict the match probability of a duplicate question with each of the original questions. The application flow for this architecture is as follows:

1. Create an Azure ML Service workspace.
2. Create an Azure ML Compute cluster.
3. Upload training, tuning, and testing data to Azure Storage.
4. Configure a HyperDrive random hyperparameter search.
5. Submit the search.
6. Monitor until complete.
7. Retrieve the best set of hyperparameters.
8. Register the best model.

## Prerequisites

1. Linux (Ubuntu).
2. [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) installed.
3. [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com).

The tutorial was developed on an [Azure Ubuntu
DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro),
which addresses the first two prerequisites.  You can allocate such a
VM on [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) by creating a "Data
Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu)" resource.

## Setup

To set up your environment to run these notebooks, please follow these steps.  They setup the notebooks to use Azure seamlessly.

1. Create a _Linux_ _Ubuntu_ VM.
2. Log in to your VM.  We recommend that you use a graphical client
   such as
   [X2Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro#x2go)
   to access your VM.  The remaining steps are to be done on the VM.
3. Open a terminal emulator.
4. Clone, fork, or download the zip file for this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/MLHyperparameterTuning.git
   ```
5. Enter the local repository:
   ```
   cd MLHyperparameterTuning
   ```
6. Create the Python MLHyperparameterTuning virtual environment using the environment.yml:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
7. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source activate MLHyperparameterTuning
   ```
   The remaining steps should be done in this virtual environment.
8. Login to Azure:
   ```
   az login
   ```
   You can verify that you are logged in to your subscription by executing
   the command:
   ```
   az account show -o table
   ```
9. If you have more than one Azure subscription, select it:
   ```
   az account set --subscription <Your Azure Subscription>
   ```
10. Start the Jupyter notebook server:
	```
	jupyter notebook
	```

## Steps

After following the setup instructions above, run the Jupyter notebooks in order starting with [00_Data_Prep_Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/Microsoft/MLHyperparameterTuning/blob/master/00_Data_Prep.ipynb).

## Cleaning up

The [last Jupyter notebook](07_Tear_Down.ipynb) describes how to delete the Azure resources created for running the tutorial. Consult the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io) for information on how to remove the conda environment created during the setup.  And if you created a VM, you may also delete it.
